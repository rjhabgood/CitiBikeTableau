# CitiBikeTableau

# This Tableau document contains several graphs that show some great trends and opportunities.
# Looking at the maps of the end locations and starting locations we can see that there is coverage through out all of Manhattan. Meaning it will be easy to find a place to drop your bike off after riding it to your destination in Manhattan
# When looking at the graphs about gender splits we can see that more people that identify as male tend to use the bikes but that those who identify as women are riding futher distances. we can also see that there is a large group of riders that we dont have gender data on. this could mean that riders are not willing to provide this data or that there are not enough options about gender identity available for them to provide that data.
# I think that when we look at trip duration vs birth year we are seeing a trend toward people born in the 90s which would make sense since they are ones that would be most physicly fit enough to ride the bikes consitantly but also be working and us the bikes as a standard mode of transportation.
